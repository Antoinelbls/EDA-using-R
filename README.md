Wine Quality Analysis
================

## Project Overview

Here we analyse two datasets,related to red and white variants of the
Portuguese *Vinho Verde* wine from an ‘objective quality’ perspective ie
we analyse the chemical properties and their interactions to determine
quality.

The project uses R to apply exploratory data analysis to understand the
relationships in one variable to mulitple variables influencing the
nature and hence the quality of the wine.
